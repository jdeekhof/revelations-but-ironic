                <h3>writer's block</h3>
                <p>Welp, so much for writing everyday in here. I've been aggressively applying/interviewing for jobs recently and that's the excuse I am going to stick to. I've got a lot of thoughts about interviewing, but I'd rather talk more about something else. I'm not exactly sure what that something else is though at the moment.</p>
                <p>I think I'm having trouble with purpose here. This is a public website and repository that literally anyone can find if they look hard enough. I've never been any good at twitter for a similar reason. The thought of a stranger making judgements about my thoughts stresses me out quite a bit. I couldn't even get that sentence out without thinking how many things are wrong with that statement.</p>
                <p> Number one, you aren't as important as you think, the chances of anyone finding these thoughts are minimal.The subsequent chances of them reading through all of them are abysmal. Number two, and the most obvious, strangers opinions don't matter. Worst case scenario, maybe you don't get a job because of a hot take that they disagree with. The thing is you don't need to please every idiot in the world. Stop trying to. Be honest and thoughtful and people will respect it. Be brave, because you obviously haven't spent much time imagining the best case scenario.</p>

                <h3>whats my favorite bit of software that I've written</h3>
                <p>The first time that I felt like I really understood classes and instances was when I spent the better part of an entire night abstracting the process of putting different types of data into certain cells on a spreadsheet. It was also the first time that I really understood what good software architecture really means. The idea is that you decide and delegate behavior to their core classes. The main problem I see when people try to do this is that they are starting from a 5000 foot level and abstracting from the top down. The issue with this is that you will need to rewrite it 50 times in order to get to the true primitive that exists at the very bottom of the project. </p>
                <p>The project I worked on was filling spreadsheets with various types of data. Making the spreadsheet consisted of adding each datum row by row. The first solution was really messy. We added datum row by row with a long list of cells inside of that `.add_row`. This means if we ever wanted to move a column to another place, we would effectively need to rewrite the entire file along with the headers. The next solution was a lot more nifty. We used procs to continue adding by row, but now a certain function would be called based on the column header. This allowed us the flexibility to move columsn really easily, but placing data in non-repeating fashion was now incredibly difficult and it was impossible to read. My solution, which was my favorite :), abstracted away the placement and allowed classes to own that detail.</p>
                <p>The solution drew off of the CSV class we used. I made a sheet class, a row class, and a column class. The column belonged to the row and the row belonged to the sheet. Now, placing data was as easy as declaring variables. Here's an example of placing some data in Sheet1!A1. 'sheet_1 = Sheet.new; a = sheet1.add_column!(name: 'Column Header Name'); one = a.add_row!; a.one.insert('some_data')'. There were some drawbacks, but now we could place data or rows with minimal effort. </p>

                <h3>language and understanding</h3>
                <p>Have you ever heard or had someone talk about the life of a dog? I find the tinge of jealousy that comes along with the thought of not having a single responsibilities so fascinating. Don't get me wrong, this is something I've joked about as well. I presume many wonder if they really mean it though. Its a simple metaphor that almost anyone can understand. The dog's life is a visceral foil that we're using to convey something we all feel from time to time: overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>It's just a little ironic. We are talking and fantasizing about a life without being able to talk or fantasize. Sure, dogs do have an understanding of language and barks, but could it ever joke about a caterpillar's life to another? A monkey with a typewriter and infinite time would produce all of Shakespeare's works, as well as endless amounts of absolute nonsense. Further, it would never understand the difference between the two. The unimaginable complexity of the fact that electrical signals in our brain causes our diaphragm to contract at frequencies to produces sound waves that represents words that form sentences that convey thoughts in other's ears is unbelievable. People argue about whether things like telekinesis and mind reading exist, not realizing that they are actively participating in it at that very moment.</p>
                <p>I wonder sometimes about the limits of language and how they relate to the limit of modern day thought. Shakespeare invented several words, did the feelings/ideas exist prior? In other words, did the chicken or the egg come first? Did the chicken and the egg pre-exist that colloquialism? People for centuries have experienced the cold-start problem on every single level of society. So I ask again, did the chicken come first or was it the egg. It was neither: the environment came first.</p>

                <h3>why do we fly at 14,000 feet in airplanes?</h3>
                <p>I saw a reddit post the other day about a young, eager employee at a major airline, let's call them Bob. Bob had come up with an idea to potentially save the entire industry millions. Bob wanted to spin up the aircraft's tires prior to landing so that the tread would not be so worn after every landing. Instead of ten landings on a set of tires, they'd be able to do hundreds! He arrived one day and proudly told his manager his idea. His disappointment was swiftly delivered. Many have come before asking the same question and the answer was the same: its a lot of unneccesary weight to add which will cost tons of fuel over the long term. Its another system that will need maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Static tires will wear more but its cheaper and safer than trying to spin them up to 200 mph. Basically, Bob's idea was dead on arrival. I think most of us can think of a story similar to Bob's from a co-worker or maybe even your managee (or maybe it was you). This story and yours just go to show how difficult it is to actually challenge convention. It's evidence that individuality and uniqueness is actually exceedingly difficult. I wager that it's growing more difficult by the day. I say this because I see a growing population, and also because our days are more and more mechanized.
                <p>I don't really want to comment at this time on why I think the world is more mechanized than ever before. It seems like an obvious truth to be honest and overly cynical to fully explain.</p>
                <p>The world is growing at the moment. We are currently at around 8 billion. The more competition, the more difficult something becomes. Take baseball for example, back when Babe Ruth played, the sport was largely a second job for most. Many played for a love of the game. The sport grew and grew. More people began watching and more began playing. Skip to today, and now you need to dedicate your life from the age of ~4 to ~25 to the sport to even have a chance to play in the big leagues. The same goes for being unique. I know, I know. Baseball is a closed game with only so many positions, how can you possibly liken that to the seemingly infinite possibilities of human capability. We have people going to space: that's entirely new and unique so you must be wrong. I concede, you win.</p>
                <p>Just kidding, you should know better by now. If you examine the medium that the explorer is exploring and only within this context, you are correct; spacemen are entirely new. But we don't live in a vacuum (too good to pass up), and explorers have existed since the dawn of time. Sure, space has it's own very unique challenges versus something like say exploring the ocean blue, but is it really all that different or unique in terms of the human perspective? They are going to a place that is unknown. We haven't truly explored the bottom of the ocean yet, do you think that those individuals are so different than modern day astronauts? To go back to the baseball comparison, it's in the same ballpark. It's still the same game. </p>
                <p>So back to Bob right? What's he to do? Be frustrated and give up? Press forward and keep working? I guess that depends on who Bob is and what he actually values. Bob, can you tell me why airplanes fly so high? Circumference is equal to pi * R^2! For every mile higher in the air, we are parabolically increasing the circumference to our destination. I bet its because of the air. It's so much less dense at 14,000 feet and even though we are going farther, the fuel to power the turbines goes a lot further. H: absolutely beautiful sunset from the plane over Boston, L: TIADIOM (this is an acronym for something I'm not comfortable sharing yet), N: I get to have Christmas with the whole family for the first time in a long time. </p>

                <h3>missed one</h3>
                <p>It seems that I missed one yesterday, I was {{generic excuse}}. I thought about lying and just back-dating this one, but why lie to literally no one? The good news is that it made me think of another mantra that I really like that I've never been able to really implement in my own life. If you want to develop a habit, never miss two days in a row. The idea is that every your entire personality stems from an individual choice that you made. That choice was repeated and then became a pattern. That pattern became a habit. That habit became your part of your character. I wager most of one's morals, our one's outlooks, and identity stem from a single thing you decided to do randomly one day. Can you remember? If that's true, most of one's character is actually just randomly collected habits. What percentage of your character was thoughtfully chosen instead of stumbled upon? </p>
                <p>I'm not going to get into the nature vs nurture argument that this seems to be leading toward, I think that it's never too late to change. How do you change? Don't miss two days in a row. If you go for a run this holiday season to work off some of the overeating(you don't have to), go the next day too. Even if its just around the block. Habits can't form until they are patterns, and two is the first opportunity to develop a pattern. That was a long winded way of saying sorry for missing yesterday....H:I remembered a wild idea that I had years ago and got started, L: I very nearly lost my wallet, N: Talked to my brother for the first time in about 6 months</p>

                <h3>a high, a low, and something new</h3>
                <p>I have this one friend that left me with a game I think everyone should try. As the title states: you choose a high, a low, and something new(ish) that happened or you remembered. You can play it at the conclusion of the day (or the next), with someone (or by yourself), and out loud (or written down). The only real rule is that you need to try to be honest and thoughtful. I've found that while it only takes a few minutes, it offers so many benefits. The good is practicing gratitude and can be as small as you need. The bad is an opportunity to improve and grow. The new is a challenge to make each day unique and more thoughtful.</p>
                <p>Its been sometime since the last time I've played, but today's a new start and I'm not giving up. Here's my good, bad, and new (respectively) for yesterday: its officially been one week since I got sober, the nachos at Starlite that were $20 and were really not worth it, and lastly, I found that not practicing for a few months is not nearly as bad as a year plus. Now your turn.</p>

                <h3>ikigai</h3>
                <p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines ikigai as "a motivating force; something or someone that gives a person a sense of purpose or a reason for living". More generally, it may refer to something that brings pleasure or fulfilment. </p>
                <p> I wonder how many essays start with a definition. I wonder if its actually ineffective like teachers say, or if teachers just didn't like the lack of originality and got bored of reading the same thing over and over again. I have a feeling that its just unoriginal. Its probably a little effective because I know that I tend to never look definitions up. It reminds me of how some of my hockey coaches would scold players for putting their hands on their knees when they were tired. "Stand up straight!". When I asked why one explained that we were reducing our lung capacity and therefore our ability to actually recover. It's just too bad neither of those are true. How much conventional wisdom from our predecessors was just incorrect? I'd wager, more than we can even imagine. I'm surprised that folks were surprised that ChatGPT and other language models spit out plainly false information. We do it constantly and we are the only data source. We've arrived at the capability of copying and pasting on a global scale, but haven't figured out etymology yet. Shall I define that one for you too?</p>
                <p>None of that has anything to do with purpose. Oh, are you sure? I think it actually does: do you believe in purpose? Who told you that the point is to have a point? Is it something you know innately? Is it something others told you? Did god tell you? I'm not a nihilist, but much like ChatGPT, you are merely repeating incorrect information. You are repeating incorrect information. You are repeating incorrect information. Is there truth in purpose? Is there purpose in truth? What the hell does math have to do with all of this? </p>

                <p>I once went on a tinder date with a girl that was quite a bit smarter than me. She said this: 'writing helps you develop your voice.' I didn't really understand that at the time, because everyone has a voice. Anyone with a mouth and grasp over a language has a voice. We literally spend almost all of our time on earth listening to people who have a voice. It's only recently that I realized what she meant. It's not the vibrations on your eardrums that matter Yes, everyone can talk but it's mostly repeating. When's the last time one has spoken with true originality? I posit that most people have not since their childhood. I am included. I intend to change that though.</p>
