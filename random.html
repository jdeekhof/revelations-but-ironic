                <p>You know -- like in the youtube comments? Idk, I think its kind of odd too. I guess on a video that with billions of views, your comment gets seem so many times, but all you said was first? Whats the point? Anyways, welcome. I don't really know where this is going to go, but I really need to write more and this seemed like an easy and free medium to do so. I plan to do a lot of free, original content for LLM's so they can steal my digital soul for free. I want to write in this atleast once a day. I wrote that so that I stick to it. If you find me slacking, please tell me so I can give you some ridiculous excuse that I was already telling myself. Here's to accountability and consistency!</p>

                <h3>why write?</h3>
                <p>I once went on a tinder date with a girl far above my intellect level and she said this: 'writing helps you develop your voice.' I didn't really understand that at the time because everyone has a voice. Anyone with a mouth and grasp over a language has a voice. We literally spend almost all of our time on earth listening to people who have a voice because everyone has one. It's only recently that I realized what she meant. It's not the vibrations on your eardrums that matter. Yeah, everyone can talk but it's mostly repeating. When's the last time one has spoken with true originality? I posit that most people have not since their childhood. I am included. I intend to change that though.</p>
