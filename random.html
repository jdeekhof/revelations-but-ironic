                <h3>missed one</h3>
                <p>It seems that I missed one yesterday, I was {{generic excuse}}. I thought about lying and just back-dating this one, but why lie to literally no one? The good news is that it made me think of another mantra that I really like that I've never been able to really implement in my own life. If you want to develop a habit, never miss two days in a row. The idea is that every your entire personality stems from an individual choice that you made. That choice was repeated and then became a pattern. That pattern became a habit. That habit became your part of your character. I wager most of one's morals, our one's outlooks, and identity stem from a single thing you decided to do randomly one day. Can you remember? If that's true, most of one's character is actually just randomly collected habits. What percentage of your character was thoughtfully chosen instead of stumbled upon? </p>
                <p>I'm not going to get into the nature vs nurture argument that this seems to be leading toward, I think that it's never too late to change. How do you change? Don't miss two days in a row. If you go for a run this holiday season to work off some of the overeating(you don't have to), go the next day too. Even if its just around the block. Habits can't form until they are patterns, and two is the first opportunity to develop a pattern. That was a long winded way of saying sorry for missing yesterday....H:I remembered a wild idea that I had years ago and got started, L: I very nearly lost my wallet, N: Talked to my brother for the first time in about 6 months/p>

                <h3>a high, a low, and something new</h3>
                <p>I have this one friend that left me with a game I think everyone should try. As the title states: you choose a high, a low, and something new(ish) that happened or you remembered. You can play it at the conclusion of the day (or the next), with someone (or by yourself), and out loud (or written down). The only real rule is that you need to try to be honest and thoughtful. I've found that while it only takes a few minutes, it offers so many benefits. The good is practicing gratitude and can be as small as you need. The bad is an opportunity to improve and grow. The new is a challenge to make each day unique and more thoughtful.</p>
                <p>Its been sometime since the last time I've played, but today's a new start and I'm not giving up. Here's my good, bad, and new (respectively) for yesterday: its officially been one week since I got sober, the nachos at Starlite that were $20 and were really not worth it, and lastly, I found that not practicing for a few months is not nearly as bad as a year plus. Now your turn.</p>

                <p>You have to because you never know where it will bring you. Never miss two days in a row. Not doing something because you're afraid is a pretty awful reason. Here's a placard for coming today, thanks.</p>

                <h3>ikigai</h3>
                <p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines ikigai as "a motivating force; something or someone that gives a person a sense of purpose or a reason for living". More generally it may refer to something that brings pleasure or fulfilment. I wonder how many essays start with a definition. I wonder if its actually ineffective or if teachers just didn't like the lack of originality and got bored of reading definitions about words they already knew. I have a feeling that its just unoriginal, but a bit effective. It sort of reminds me of how some of my hockey coaches would scold players for putting their hands on their knees when they were tired. "Stand up straight! You are reducing your lung capacity and your ability to actually recover!". Too bad neither of those are true. How much convential wisdom from our predescessors was just incorrect? I'd wager, more than we can even imagine. I'm surprised that folks were surprised that ChatGPT and other language models spit out plainly false information. We do it constantly and we are the only data source. We've arrived at the capability of copying and pasting on a global scale, but haven't figured out etymology yet. Shall I define that one for you too? </p>
                <p>None of that has anything to do with purpose. Oh, are you sure? I think it actually does: do you believe in purpose? Who told you that the point is to have a point? Is it something you know innately? Is it something others told you? Did god tell you? I'm not a nihilist, but much like ChatGPT, you are merely repeating incorrect information. You are repeating incorrect information. You are repeating incorrect information. Is there truth in purpose? Is there purpose in truth? What the hell does math have to do with all of this? </p>

                <h3>why write?</h3>
                <p>I once went on a tinder date with a girl that was quite a bit smarter than me. She said this: 'writing helps you develop your voice.' I didn't really understand that at the time because everyone has a voice. Anyone with a mouth and grasp over a language has a voice. We literally spend almost all of our time on earth listening to people who have a voice because everyone has one. It's only recently that I realized what she meant. It's not the vibrations on your eardrums that matter. Yeah, everyone can talk but it's mostly repeating. When's the last time one has spoken with true originality? I posit that most people have not since their childhood. I am included. I intend to change that though.</p>

                <h3>first</h3>
                <p>You know -- like in the youtube comments? Idk, I think its kind of odd too. I guess on a video that with billions of views, your comment gets seem so many times, but all you said was first? Whats the point? Anyways, welcome. I don't really know where this is going to go, but I really need to write more and this seemed like an easy and free medium to do so. I plan to do a lot of free, original content for LLM's so they can steal my digital soul for free. I want to write in this atleast once a day. I wrote that so that I stick to it. If you find me slacking, please tell me so I can give you some ridiculous excuse that I was already telling myself. Here's to accountability and consistency!</p>
